# OS environment variables can be used to tell carbon where graphite is

#   GRAPHITE_ROOT        - Root directory of the graphite installation.
#                          Defaults to /opt/graphite
#   GRAPHITE_CONF_DIR    - Configuration directory (where this file lives).
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/conf/
#   GRAPHITE_STORAGE_DIR - Storage directory for whipser/rrd/log/pid files.
#                          Defaults to $GRAPHITE_ROOT/storage/

# Pipeline configuration #
##########################
# This defines what the carbon daemon does with metric data it receives
# or generates. Generally there are two behaviors: to relay the
# data on to other carbon daemons, or to write the data to disk.
# There are a few optional processing features that can be configured
# as well.
# The available pipeline functions are:
#   aggregate - use aggregation-rules.conf to buffer datapoints
#               and compute aggregates. Generated metrics go
#               through the whole pipeline (including aggregation).
#               Loops are possible, be careful.
#      filter - apply filer rules defined in filter-rules.conf to
#               metric names. Rules are applied in order and action on match
#               is taken immediately. Metrics which match an 'exclude' rule
#               are dropped from futher pipeline processors. Metrics matching no
#               rules will be accepted by default
#     rewrite - apply rewrite rules defined in rewrite-rules.conf
#               to metric names. Renamed metrics continue through
#               the pipeline, they do not start over at the beginning.
#       relay - send metric data on to DESTINATIONS specified in relay.conf
#       write - put metric data into the Cache and configure the Writer
#               to write all cached data to the configured database.
#
# The only rule is that 'write' and 'relay may only appear
# at the end of the pipeline and all pipelines must end
# in one of those two. For this reason it is common to refer
# to carbon daemons as either "writers" or "relays", even though
# either may do other stuff like aggregation as well.
#
# If you want to do a lot of expensive processing you might
# configure one or more carbon daemons to be dedicated just to
# pre-processing like so:
#
# PIPELINE = aggregate, filter, rewrite, relay
#
# With separate carbon daemons doing writing and cache management.
#
# PIPELINE = write
#
# This is a good way to keep the writers' cpu usage low, which
# keeps cache queries more responsive, and thus the webapp is
# more responsive.

PIPELINE = write

# By default we use a "secure" pickle implementation (see Bug #817247 for details).
# There is a small amount of overhead introduced by this. If you really need
# the speed at the expense of having an easily exploitable security hole you
# can enable the faster insecure unpickler. In general you should not expose your
# Graphite system to untrusted hosts/users anyways.
USE_INSECURE_UNPICKLER = False

# TODO: amorton, find a better way to set these. Env vars seem to be ignored
